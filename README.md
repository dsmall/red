Red is the web-based editor that is built-in to every Rascal.

(What is the Rascal? It is a small computer that helps scientists control their instruments, artists make art interactive, and engineers connect to the web faster. More details at [rascalmicro.com][1].)

Red is not a cloud service; the Rascal runs a webserver that hosts Red.

Red is based around [CodeMirror][2], a Javascript editor component. Red adds a file browser, drag-and-drop file upload, and a suite of functionality that is specific to the operation of the Rascal hardware, like the ability to reload Python code on the Rascal on the fly.
