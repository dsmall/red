red with tabs
============

--

#### WORTH NOTING

1. There is always at least one tab. red starts out with an anonymous tab "untitled-1",
anonymous in the sense that it has no file associated with it. Anonymous tabs are reused
for files or messages.
2. You can only close the active tab.
3. You can close the last tab but it will be replaced by an anonymous tab.
4. The preferred way to dismiss a picture is by clicking it.
5. You can open a page from the filetree by Cmd-Click. See `click-test.html` for a full list.

#### DONE

* Upload - make status read only and track by tab (will also apply to log and Reload Pytronics)
* Factor out JS into separate files
* Change default shown handler to delegated
* Reduce tab height  (padding-top/bottom currently reduced from 8px to 4px)
* Multiple highlighting of filetree
* Rename, copy or move picture or file (many use cases)
* Go back to allowing spaces in file and folder names (use  secure path instead of secure folder)
* Consolidate styles
* Reload pytronics

#### KNOWN BUGS

* Move folder when one or more of its files is open

#### UNDER CONSIDERATION

* Bracket completion (preference)
* Close all but this tab
* Save all
* Linter (preference)
* Make "jsDocstring" a preference 
* Drag width of filetree
* Automatic loading of modes
* Display fonts as page from font book
